      <h1>Learning the Secret</h1>

      <p>Turn on television at any time in the early morning hours and you will see an infomercial of some so-called
        expert pushing their book on how to be successful. From weight loss to financial security, everyone has some
        “secret,” that they would love to let you in on for two simple payments of $29.95. The fascination we have with
        people and commercials like this is in the word, “secret.” It implies there is a way that only they have
        discovered to accomplish a common goal that all of us want to achieve. Here is an even more amazing thing, if it
        were free you wouldn’t want it, but because there is a cost, there must be something to it. The secret to your
        success is found in their book and is only a phone call away.
      </p>

      <p>As believers we know that there are no special formulas or hidden antidotes to living a victorious Christian
        life. Any success that we have is found in Christ Jesus and is given to us in the only book that really matters:
        our Bibles. But are there secrets in the Bible that are available to us who have put our faith in Him? Is there
        something that may sound so simple but many of us find hard to understand or apply to our lives? To many
        Christians, sometimes there are simple application of God’s word that are “secrets” that they may not have yet
        discovered.
      </p>

      <p>In the book of Philippians, Paul gives us this verse, “I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is
        to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or
        hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.” (Philippians 4:12 NIV) In this simple verse, Paul tells us that
        there is a secret in the Christian life to being content in every situation that we may face. And this secret
        not only applies to us when we are down and going through tough times, but is even applicable when times are
        good and full of peace. Whether he was well fed or hungry, Paul found this hidden secret in Christ Jesus.
      </p>

      <p>And what is that “secret” that Paul has discovered and how can we grab hold of it for ourselves? Let’s look at
        the next verse, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” (Philippians 4:13 NIV) Why would Paul
        call this promise from God a secret? Can it be that most of us, and I can add myself to this list, don’t realize
        the full potential of its meaning? Can it be that something so easy to read with our minds is not so easy to
        obtain in our hearts and spirits? If it’s as simple as it seems, why would Paul have called it a secret?
      </p>

      <p>The first half of the verse says, “I can do ALL things…” Paul doesn’t say some things, most things or even a
        majority of things, he stresses that he can do ALL things. How many of us really grasp the promise of the word
        “all”? I know I have a difficult time understanding it. Through my own fears and sometimes lack of faith, I have
        limited the things God wanted to do in my own life. I can honestly say there are things that I am one hundred
        percent certain God will take care of for me, but then there are other larger problems where my faith starts to
        waiver. Sometimes past failures can even convince you that obstacles in your life will never be defeated. In
        this verse, Paul wants to teach us this secret that with God there is no limit, but that we can do ALL THINGS.
      </p>

      <p>And how are these things accomplished? How does a believer in Christ Jesus reach that potential given to us, to
        do “All things”? Here is the secret that we must learn.
      </p>

      <p>These goals or hurdles are only accomplished through one power source, “Christ who strengthens me.” It sounds
        simple right? But not many Christians have such an easy grasp on this concept. I remember growing up as a little
        kid and into my teenage years, the church my mom took me gave me a totally different idea of what Christianity
        was. I thought that God and I had a 50/50 partnership. I would try my hardest or give my best effort, and seeing
        that God would give me just enough power to push me over the top. Some of you are even saying to yourselves
        right now, that sounds about right. It’s the old theory that “God helps those that helps themselves.” Although
        that sounds right, it is nowhere to be found in scripture. Jesus Said, “Apart from me you can do NOTHING…” He is
        the only supplier of the power and strength that we need to accomplish “ALL THINGS” in His name. Without God’s
        help of showing us this powerful secret, we can continue to fall into that endless cycle that is ultimately
        bound for discouragement. We’ve all done it, you try to mentally convince yourself that you can overcome some
        unwanted trouble or habitual sin only to have it defeat you time and time again. I’ve been there too many times.
        It’s only when I stopped trying and learned to believe in His power that I found victory. What a relief it is to
        find that the only power to be victorious was never found in me at all. All my strength can only come from one
        power source, who is Christ Jesus. If the secret to Christianity was you finding an internal source to defeat or
        overcome these trials in life, the Bible would have mentioned it. But it doesn’t. The only source of strength we
        can receive to be victorious is found in Christ Jesus.
      </p>

      <p>So how is this secret revealed in our lives? How does God not only give us merely a mental understanding that
        we are powerless without Him, but place it in our hearts so that it’s something we truly believe? One way is
        through trials, hardships and difficulties. It can come though the loss of a loved one, a health issue or even
        financial troubles. Anything that seems to throw us out of our comfort zone, God will use to show us how weak we
        really are. I’ve noticed that the greatest lesson I’ve ever learned was when God allowed the bottom to fall out
        so I was helpless until He came through. When we go through times that everything seems to be fine, we seem to
        lose a need for God. But when everything seems to be going in the wrong direction we run for His protection and
        help. Now it almost sounds as though God’s intention is to make us weak. Again, I was taught that weakness was a
        sign of immaturity or having a lack of faith but here again is the secret. It’s the exact opposite… Only through
        your weakness is God’s full power revealed. Sounds strange right? Then you too need to learn the secret.
      </p>

      <p>In 2 Corinthians, Paul writes this verse that goes against all of our understanding and as in my case, what I
        was taught as a child. The Lord said to him, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in
        weakness.” Paul’s response was, “Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that
        Christ’s power may rest on me… for when I am weak, then am I strong…” (2 Corinthians 12:9-10 NIV) In order for
        us Christians to fully see God’s power working in our lives, we must become weak. Seeing the full potential of
        God’s power is not standing up to our troubles in our own strength but down on our knees, humbly, in prayer.
        It’s that believer who cries out in their heart that they are helpless without Him that really taps into the
        full power of God himself. Strangely, boasting about your weakness allows, “Christ’s power to rest on you.”
        God’s strength is made perfect in your weakness.
      </p>

      <p>If you’re a Believer and you’re going through a difficult time and things just don’t seem to make much sense,
        don’t lose hope. In our natural mind we have the tendency to believe that God is far away when in fact He may be
        even closer than He has ever been. Hold on to the word of God and these special promises that He has provided
        us. Rely not on your own strength but totally on His power. Your trials may not be as strange as they seem, it
        may just be God’s way of letting you in on His powerful secret….
      </p>

      <p>Just Something to Consider.
