      <h1>Driven by Hope</h1>
      <p>By A.C.</p>

      <p>Many people who turn out to be successful in life seem to be driven by some inner force. And that one thing is
        the essential element that keeps them motivated no matter how distant their ultimate goals may be. A successful
        business man or woman can be driven by money or material things. A professional athlete can be driven by the
        thought of one day being a champion. Hollywood stars are usually consumed by seeing their name in lights. Fame
        to these celebrities seem to be their most inspiring factor. The thought of reaching the pinnacle of a career
        that is obtainable by only a small percentage of the population is the driving force behind what society
        considers people who are successful. These people have achieved so called success because they have been driven
        by something other than just plain hard work.</p>

      <p>If you asked the average Christian today what is the driving force behind their belief in God, you may hear all
        sorts of different answers. Faith, Grace, and Love are just a few that immediately come to mind. All of them are
        inspired and given by God and are a major part of our salvation. But behind all of these words that we know in
        our spirit to be true, is this small but powerful word called HOPE. Hope is the essential gift of God that not
        only inspires our salvation but ultimately drives it. </p>

      <p>Now before I go any further, I want to make one important thing perfectly clear. Hope is not “a wish.” As
        Christians, we don’t wish for things to come true. We go to God faithfully in prayer knowing He will provide,
        according to His will, the very request we are making. And we believe, in hope, that through His love and
        kindness, He will answer those things we are asking. Now you may be thinking that you go to God through faith
        when you pray. And you absolutely do, but faith and hope are somehow joined together. Let me try to explain.
        Hebrews 11:1 says, “Faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.” (NIV) Hope
        is an internal, joyous assurance of things to come, placed in our spirit by God Himself. According to the writer
        of Hebrews, hope is the confidence of our faith and the link to the unseen promises of God. </p>

      <p>Now the bible tells us that Satan has many devices that he uses in order to get our focus off of serving God.
        Notice the word “devices” is plural, meaning that there are many of them. Sin is probably the biggest tool in
        his arsenal. It’s my opinion that attacking our hope, is right up there as well. He knows that because faith and
        hope are linked together, if he can damage one the other will fall also. How many of us have been on the brink
        of giving up not because we were tempted by Satan to sin but because we lost sight of God’s promises? These
        promises are given through hope. If Satan can discourage you and cause you to give up hope, he has the inside
        track on your faith. He will try and convince you that the promises and hope that are given in scripture are
        untrue or don’t apply to you. This is his first step in achieving his goal.</p>

      <p>That’s why God not only puts these promises in writing but pledges them to us through someone we can have total
        assurance on: His SON. “For all the promises of God in Him (Christ Jesus) are yea…” (2 Corinthians 1:20 KJV) The
        New Living Translation seems to explain it a little clearer… “For ALL of God’s promises have been fulfilled in
        Christ with a resounding ‘YES!’” Remember this, our hope as His children is not that God applies His promises to
        us if we are lucky or through chance, it’s that He guarantees them through the life of His Risen Son. When
        you’re being attacked in your spirit and Satan is telling you “what’s the use of continuing?” keep in mind-
        Jesus is the source of all your hope. </p>

      <p>Even the trials and hardships that God allow into our lives have divine purposes of supplying us with hope. Now
        most of us don’t look at it that way. How many of us when we are being beaten down by the problems of life have
        even the smallest sense that God is building up our Hope? I know I don’t. One of the first things we tend to do
        is blame these problems on our own mistakes, the misfortune that comes with life, or our own bad behavior. If
        you listen to certain so-called Christian ministers, they would have you believe unknown hidden sin is the cause
        for these troubles. Let’s look at the book of Romans for the true answer. </p>

      <p>Romans 5:3-5 says, “…but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;
        perseverance, character; and character, hope…” (NIV) Now you would think that it should read that suffering,
        perseverance, and character would produce strength and power to fight off the devil right? That’s how I would
        have written it. Can it be that God is trying to reveal to us the power that comes from hope? Look at the two
        other attributes that come along with hope. Perseverance and character. Perseverance is the determination to
        continue on regardless of what we are facing. Character is the pose in which we do it. Both driven along by this
        powerful word called hope. </p>

      <p>So if hope is one of the important essential qualities of being a believer, how do we receive it into our
        lives? Is hope a mental game in which we try to trick or convince our minds into thinking that something will
        one day take place? Who is the supplier of this hope? I think you know where this is going… Romans 15:13, “May
        the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the
        power of the Holy Spirit.” (NIV) This verse is so powerful in so many ways. </p>

      <p>First, notice He is not a God who has hope but is the God OF hope. He is the very source of our hope. It’s not
        that He shares some of the hope He has with us, it’s so much stronger than that. By His very nature He supplies
        our hope through Himself in an overflowing abundance. God has an infinite supply of hope. </p>

      <p>Secondly, I could comprehend it better if this verse said, “May the God of hope fill you with hope.” But it
        doesn’t. Strangely the verse doesn’t say God directly gives us hope, it says, “may He fill you with joy and
        peace,” and through these thing working together you get hope. In other words, the hope we receive has two
        powerful companions: Joy and Peace, and they work hand in hand to supply us with hope. My old math teacher would
        have written like this. Joy + Peace = Overflow of Hope. </p>

      <p>Lastly, how is this hope given to us and what is the source? This is where this verse gets more interesting. It
        tells us, “As we trust in him… by the Power of the Holy Spirit.” The only way for believers to receive the life
        sustaining hope we receive from God is if we put our total trust in Him. And only through that trust do we
        receive joy, peace and all the hope God has for us. The key word that generates all of God’s promises is in the
        word “trust.” </p>

      <p>But what happens if you have been so pounded by the hardships of life that trust is hard to come by? Have you
        ever been through times where you feel so hopeless that you wonder if this whole thing called Christianity was
        true? Sadly I’ve been there. The devil at times had twisted my thoughts that I wondered if any of this was real
        and not just some tale passed down through time. He had me hopeless. So, does this mean we are dismissed and
        left out of this great promise of hope until we can muster up enough trust in God? Does God leave us to
        ourselves until we mentally psych ourselves into believing him? Never… The most important factor regarding this
        verse in Romans is this… Everything is performed “through the power of the Holy Spirit.” This supernatural power
        that God has put inside all of us not only gives us the Hope we need to persevere, but the trust in God we need
        to obtain it. I have many times asked God to not only give me the strength I need to overcome some trouble, but
        the faith I need to believe I can overcome it. John said, “This is the confidence that we have in approaching
        God: that if we ask ANYTHING according to His will, He hears us.” (1 John 5:14 NIV). </p>

      <p>Did you ever think of asking Him to give you the power to believe? I sure have. </p>

      <p>If you think hopelessness is something we shouldn’t take serious, consider this. According to Suicide Awareness
        and Prevention, over 1 million people take their lives worldwide each year. On average, one person dies every 40
        seconds each day somewhere in the world by suicide. Imagine in the time it may have taken you to read this
        article 10 poor, hopeless souls have gone into eternity away from the presence of God forever. I have no
        statistics to back this up but I can almost guarantee a large portion of these tragic deaths were caused by
        people who lost all hope. </p>

      <p>1 Peter gives us this command as believers that really convicts me and makes me realize how I have failed in
        this area of my life. Writing this article, especially the last paragraph, has made me understand why. </p>

      <p>“But in your heart revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to EVERYONE who asks you to give
        the reason for the Hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect.” (1 Peter 3:15 NIV) </p>

      <p>Just Something to Consider.</p>
