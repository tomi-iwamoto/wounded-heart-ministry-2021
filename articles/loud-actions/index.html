        <h1>Loud Actions</h1>

      <p>“Be careful how you act,” these were the words of warning given to my sons before we took them to anyone’s house for a visit. From the time they were very young, 
        my wife ingrained this into them to make sure that they behaved and acted in a way that didn’t make them look unruly and out of control. More importantly, 
        “Don’t let your actions embarrass us, your parents.” You see, the impression you leave on people when you’re no longer in their presence isn’t in the fancy clothes 
        you wear, or your neatly combed hair. What they remember most is how you conduct yourself. How did you act while you were with them? That is what people remember most. 
        Your actions always leave a lasting impression. The old saying is true… Actions speak louder than words.
      </p>

      <p>As Christians, one of the most important things we should always be conscious of is our actions. Having a desire to spread the Gospel and being doctrinally sound are 
        all vital but as believers, it all pales in comparison to the way we act. This simple fact was true even from the early days of the Christian faith. 
        In a letter to the church that he started in Philippi, Paul gives important instructions to these new converts on how they should behave now that they have become 
        Christians. He writes, “Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the Gospel of Christ.” (Philippians 1:27 NIV) Right from the start, Paul’s concern 
        for these new believers was not that they knew about the gifts of the Spirit or end time events, which all have their place. His concern for them was this… Act like a 
        Christian. You represent Christ Jesus. Don’t let the way you behave tarnish the message of His Gospel.

      </p>

      <p>So under what circumstances is a Christian expected to act and conduct themselves in a positive manner? Should it fluctuate according to what we are going through? The answer is found in the first two words of the verse… ”Whatever Happens.” Whether your life is currently full of blessing or if it seems as though your world is caving in, we should always be conscious of who we are and conduct ourselves in any circumstance like Christians. And at all times. Whether you’re in the middle of a large crowd or sitting quietly alone, act with the consciousness that you belong to Christ. Allow the character that His Spirit created to dictate your every action. A friend of mine told me something this week that has really stuck with me. She said, “Character is how you act when no one else is watching.” What she meant was this: The mark of a true Christian is not always seen when we are together with fellow believers, or in church raising our hands in prayer. We thank God for those times. But our character is revealed through our actions when the heat of life is bearing down on us and the decisions we make while no one else is around. The way we conduct ourselves, our character, either stands or falls with life’s pressures. This same friend is a perfect example of these actions. She has gone through some tough times over the last few years and recently was faced with an extremely tough decision. Through Faith, should she stand on God’s word and take a financial loss or go against scripture just to have financial stability? When life constantly beats you down, it is always simple to take the easy road. But in that quiet hour while no one was watching, by God Grace, my friend's choice was to conduct herself in a manner worthy of His Gospel. Did it work out the way she planned? In this life only time can say, but she prevailed, with her integrity intact, conducting herself as a Christian, when no one but God was watching. Was she opposed by friends who felt her decision was wrong? Probably. Would it have been easier for her to take the safe and easier way out? Absolutely. But she can rest her head knowing that in the toughest of times she acted with the utmost integrity. Remembering what Paul said, “Whatever Happens,” conduct yourself like a Christian… There are no exceptions.

      </p>

      <p>I have always found this verse to be extremely interesting in this. It doesn’t say to “Conduct yourself in a manner worthy of Christ,” it says to conduct in a manner “worthy of THE GOSPEL of Christ.” In other words, your conduct is somehow linked not only to Christ but to His Gospel as well. Jesus told us to go out into this world and spread the Gospel. This verse tells us not only to spread it but more importantly to live it… Always behave and act in every situation with the consciousness that Christ died for you. Never act in a reckless or careless manner because your conduct reflects His Gospel and any negative actions can directly tarnish that message. A message that He brutally gave His life to create. Imagine the responsibility that we have that somehow our bad behavior can give the world a negative image of not only Christ but His Gospel as well. Isn’t that especially true today? Most people have a harsh view of Christianity not because of the words Jesus once spoke but because of the actions His people now exhibit. Imagine this, the message of the cross damaged by our actions, it’s a scary thought isn’t it?

      </p>

      <p>In the book of Acts, we read this interesting story of two men in Prison, Paul and Silas and how their actions changed the lives of many people. In Acts 16:16-34, the bible says that Paul and Silas were severely beaten and tossed into prison for casting out the evil spirit of a possessed woman. While in prison, a jailer was commanded to guard them closely. As was a custom in those days, the jailer was not only charged to watch his prisoners but was also responsible for their lives. If somehow these prisoners got free, then the jailer himself would be put to death. While in prison sometime about midnight, Paul and Silas, full of blood and still in chains, started praising God. Unlike most times, Paul wasn’t preaching from scripture trying to make converts of his fellow inmates. This time was different. At this dark hour in Paul’s life, not knowing what His future held, he was in prison still praising God. Unsure whether they would be facing execution, Paul and Silas were conducting themselves like Christians even when things seemed hopeless. As the story went, through their praises, God violently shook the jail, then locks fell off and all the prison doors flew open and everyone’s chains came loose (the bible implies even the chains of the other prisoners). When the jailer woke up and saw what happened, he attempted to kill himself knowing that if anyone escaped it would cost him his life, but Paul told him, “Don’t harm yourself! We are ALL here!” Could they have escaped? Absolutely. Honestly I know what I would have done. But through faith, Paul and Silas passed up certain freedom and remained in their cell. Their actions amazed and touched the jailer that his first words were, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” Did Paul or Silas preach an inspiring word to get this result? No, in fact the bible never mentions that they even spoke to the jailer at all. Strangely not a word was spoken. All they did was conduct themselves in a manner that brought glory to His Gospel. The power of the Gospel that changed this man and eventually his entire family didn’t come from any words preached from a pulpit, it came through the action lived by two frightened men in a prison cell. This should give us all hope. There is power not only in the words we speak but in the actions we live every day in front of others, controlled by the Spirit of God inside us.

      </p>

      <p>Whether we realize it or not, when we make a confession of faith in Jesus, people are constantly listening and watching our every move. They are waiting to see through our conduct if what we profess is real. Is it something we live or just empty words?

      </p>

      <p>We need to ask the power of God to control and dictate our every move. The reputation of His Gospel is on the line…

      </p>

      <p>Just Something to Consider.
