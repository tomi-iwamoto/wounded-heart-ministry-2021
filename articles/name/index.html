      <h1>What's in a Name</h1>

      <p>"Sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me." This is what our parents told us to tell
        the bullies in the park who were teasing us. They thought that this phrase would end the harassment and abuse
        that we experienced whenever we went outside to play. I figured it was their way of saying, “Fight you own
        battles and leave me out of it.”
      </p>

      <p>In our world today, that old saying wouldn’t apply cause words can and will hurt you. In some cases of cyber
        bullying, young tormented kids have taken their lives due to the endless abuse of words they’ve encountered on a
        daily basis. The African American community have fought an endless battle to remove the use of the “N” word and
        rightfully so, due to the horrible images it brings to mind. This word should never be used either in
        conversation or song. Never. We should never use hurtful words based on race, religion or sexual lifestyles. As
        Christians we are not supposed to ridicule those who practice lifestyles contrary to God's word. We are told to
        pray for them.
      </p>

      <p>In the history of mankind there is probably one word that stirs up more controversy than any other. It’s a word
        that has caused a split in marriages, separated the closes of friends, and in some cases, caused people their
        very lives. In fact, this word not only causes a restless reaction to man, it even causes the demons in hell to
        tremble. That word is the name of Jesus… His name can cause the calmest of conversations to turn into the most
        heated of arguments in an instance. If you think I’m exaggerating, next time you go to a family function or
        backyard barbecue try this; instead of telling someone, “go to church” or “believe in the big guy upstairs,”
        tell them you follow Jesus. See their reaction. I promise you it’s a show stopper. The reaction we get towards
        His name shouldn’t come as a surprise to us. Jesus himself told us he didn’t come to bring peace but a sword.
      </p>

      <p>Jesus' name will divide the best of friends and the closest of loved ones. His name is so powerful that Satan
        himself will do anything to prevent us from using it. Imagine for a minute when we are attacked and we call on
        Jesus’ name. Satan watches as his entire demonic army trembles and hides. That’s what they do, run and hide at
        the mention of Jesus' name. We don’t think of it like that but it’s true. His name is so powerful it makes all
        hell shake but it can also set a loved one free from sin and is the only name according to Peter that can save
        us. There is power in His name. We must use it as often as we can.
      </p>

      <p>So when did believers first start to invoke the name of Jesus and when did society first try to eliminate it?
        It’s not as recent as you think. In fact this all began at the birth of the Christian church. Let’s look in the
        bible in chapters 3 and 4 of the book of Acts. Peter and John are heading to the Temple when they see a man
        crippled from birth begging at the Temple Gate called Beautiful. As they approach, the man asked the Apostles
        for some money. Peter turned to him and said these famous words, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do
        have I give you. IN THE NAME of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” (Acts 3:6 NIV) The man was instantly healed.
        Believers have been using that powerful phrase ever since. Isn’t it funny how God used the very disciple who
        denied knowing Jesus several weeks earlier to be the first to use His name? The teachers of the law and the
        religious leaders were instantly aggravated by the use of Jesus' name. You see, they thought they had eliminated
        His name when they unjustly crucified Jesus. They were wrong. After throwing Peter and John in prison for a
        night, they gave the Apostles this stern warning, “not to speak or teach at all IN THE NAME of Jesus.” (Acts
        4:18 NIV) This is when the trend began right up until today. In public you can say "God" or "Lord" but mention
        Jesus and you’re in for an immediate confrontation. There is something in His name that causes that reaction.
        Satan tried to kill His name at the beginning of the Christian church. That’s why when we are made fun of and
        ridiculed for the name of Jesus, Peter told us we are blessed. He should know firsthand.
      </p>

      <p>Take it as a compliment that you bear His Name. With all of the pressure it brings is it hard to stand up for
        His name. Yes, I am shameful and guilty of this myself. Please remember to pray for me. There is pressure in
        feeling like an outcast or being rejected by someone you love. Many times I have opted for saying, “I believe in
        God.” But I say this with all respect, what God? Paul tells us there are many gods and many lords but there is
        only One Jesus… Use His name as often as you can. God’s word tells us that there will come a day when, “every
        knee will bow" and every tongue that ever cursed or used His name in vain, will "confess that Jesus Christ is
        Lord.” (Philippians 2:10-11 NIV) Everyone. Even your arrogant boss and coworkers. I sometimes get scared for the
        late night comics who use His name as a cheap punch line to a meaningless joke. The Son of the living God used,
        to get a laugh. If they only knew.
      </p>

      <p>As Christians, His name brings comfort, hope, peace and is our only means of salvation. It’s the only name that
        will help you in your fight with the enemy. The demons know it. Do you?
      </p>

      <p>Call on His powerful name today. He is waiting to respond. May the Grace of our Lord be with you.
      </p>

      <p>Something to consider.
