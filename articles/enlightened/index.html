        <h1>Enlightened</h1>

      <p>The heart is the very core of the human body.</p>


      <p>This small object about the size of the human fist starts beating long before birth and continues,
        steadily until the time of death. Its main function is to pump blood at a steady pace throughout the body.
        Night and day whether we are conscious of it or not it continues to supply our entire body with the blood it
        needs in order to survive.
        Strangely as Christians, our hearts have another function as well... Without it we can die a spiritual death. A
        slow spiritual death.</p>



      <p>Whenever a person becomes a believer in Christ Jesus, they get a sense of purpose for their life- that God has
        saved them not just to attend
        a building once a week but to do something only they were created to accomplish. The New Testament calls this,
        “God’s will.”
        Some believers get this sense of purpose through reading the Bible or some inner voice leading them in an area
        that they would never think of on their own.
        Many also get this sense of calling through prophetic words spoken by another Christian over their lives.</p>



      <p>Regardless of the way it is received, this “calling” becomes the immediate target of our enemy, the devil.
        Satan wants nothing more
        than to kill that seed of purpose in a believer’s life right from its inception. He knows that if it is able to
        grow inside our
        hearts there is nothing through God’s power we can’t accomplish. One of the several ways he tries to accomplish
        this is by bringing
        us feelings of doubt and hopelessness. It is that thought in our mind that says, “Is this really what God said?”
        or “Do you see my
        circumstances, how can that possibly happen?” You see, many times when we look at things with our natural minds
        the fulfillment of
        the purpose and calling of God seem virtually impossible. And if we let the lies of Satan take root they become
        almost unbelievable.</p>


      <p>That’s where the heart comes in…</p>



      <p>In Ephesians 1:18, Paul writes this verse to all fellow believers. “I pray that the eyes of your heart may be
        enlightened in order
        that you may know the hope to which He has called you.” You see, our hearts not only pump blood throughout our
        natural bodies but
        as Christians they also have eyes… Spiritual eyes. It sees through the Spirit, the calling and purpose of God in
        our lives. Through
        hope it once again restores us to the things that God “planned for us in advance to do.” These callings aren’t
        formed in our minds
        where they can be effect by Satan’s lies, they are implanted in our hearts by God the Holy Spirit. The enemy can
        and will use outside
        circumstances to affect our thoughts but he can never directly influence our hearts. It is in our hearts where
        the “hope of His calling”
        is planted and Paul’s prayer is that these spiritual eyes are opened so we can see that hope. When our hearts
        are enlightened we don’t
        see the circumstances around us that cause us to say, “this is impossible,” instead our hearts can see that,
        “all the promises of God are
        'Yes' in Christ.” (2 Corinthians 1:20) These promises and callings are seen only by the eyes of our hearts.</p>





      <p>Jesus said "Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where
        thieves do not break in and steal.
        For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Matthew 6:20-21</p>



      <p>… Praying that you will be enlightened by Hope this new year.</p>
