      <h1>Boy, Do We Need Each Other!</h1>

      <p>Recently, I decided after a year of not doing much physical activity that it was time to return to the gym.
        When I was younger, getting up to run or do some sort of strenuous activity didn’t seem to bother me much. I
        would wake up, go for a run, shower then go off to work. Now twenty five years later I’m not as motivated as I
        was when I was younger. It’s funny but I can do the same things I did when I was a kid but at a much slower
        pace. The biggest problem that I have is that the motivation and drive is gone. The thought of waking up and
        running on a treadmill for forty minutes just doesn’t give me that same spark as it did when I was a kid. In my
        mind, because I’m getting older and want to improve my health, I would love to be in better condition.
        Unfortunately, my body never got the same message that my mind did. The lack of motivation has put my mind and
        body on two totally different pages. Lucky for me, I have a wife who is very supportive. She will give me words
        of encouragement that motivates me to put on my sneakers, get on my sweats and get to the gym. Honestly, there
        are times I want to say “I quit,” but have been encouraged to continue just because of the kind, motivating
        words she speaks. Many times it was just her words alone that have kept me going.
      </p>

      <p>Motivation and encouragement is a big part of serving God. Whenever a person first becomes a new creation in
        Christ Jesus they go through a period of what seems like, “all joy all of the time.” Pastor James fondly calls
        this the honeymoon period. You may know what I mean. It’s the first time you get saved and everything is fresh
        and new and you’re running at a spiritual high all of the time. Then sadly as the natural trials and pressures
        of life start to hit, you seem to lose that emotional edge. Although your spirit may not be affected, the
        natural course of life’s hardship can be an emotional drain.
      </p>

      <p>So what is God’s remedy for believers when they start to lose that extra something they had when they first got
        saved? How does He bring His children the encouragement to keep going even in the midst of hardship and trials?
      </p>

      <p>God can comfort us and motivate us directly, and He does often, but the Bible also says in Hebrews 10:23-25
        (NIV), “Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for He who promised is faithful. And let us consider
        how we can spur one another on (motivate) towards love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as
        some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another- and all the more as you see the Day
        approaching.” The simple remedy that God has provided for all believers in which we can, “spur one another on,”
        is this … That we do not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing. Whether in church on
        Sunday, at someone’s home during the week, or just meeting to have a quick meal, there is something powerful
        when we as believers gather together. And we should be doing it even more, during these evil times, as we see
        the “Day” approaching. Just being in the presence of other believers seems to provide an essential push that we
        all need. The motivations and encouragement provided when all of His believers are gathered together is an
        essential key to moving on through tough times. It’s a motivating and encouraging strength that we can easily
        overlook. God’s key to re-energizing us is simple: Make sure on a constant basis you spend lots of time with
        your Christian brothers and sisters. Although to some of us this seems easy and practical, unfortunately, many
        have already stopped doing it.
      </p>

      <p>So what is the protocol when believers gather together? Does the Bible give specific instructions as to what
        must be done or said when we are in each other’s company? Jesus said, “For where two or three come together in
        my name, there am I with them.” (Matthew 18:20 NIV) We all have heard that one before. Pastors have used this
        verse in their sermons down through the centuries. One thing that I never realized when Jesus said this was, He
        never said pray, read the bible or sing hymns, He just said, “gather together.” Are all of these other things
        important and have a proper place? Of course. But there is something about just being in the company of other
        Believers that brings God Himself in their midst. It can be when you’re eating a nice meal or just talking about
        current events, God is there with you. This came to me recently when I was with the people I see on Sunday at
        the church that I attend. Every week, we spend an hour together before service just talking or laughing about
        things that happened to us the prior week. Even something that sounds as simple as this is unknowingly
        encouraging and building up my spirit. Honestly, there are times that I get more encouragement by just being in
        their presence than if I were alone in prayer. The freedom that comes when you speak openly with your brothers
        and sisters and the love that manifests, can only be felt through experience. The Bible says that God is love,
        and His love is felt because he is right there in the middle of us.
      </p>

      <p>So is it just to have a feel good moment or to encourage one another to move on that Jesus told us to gather in
        groups of two or more? I think there is more to than that.</p>

      <p>The book of Ecclesiastes says, “If two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?
        Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.”
        (Ecclesiastes 4:11-12 NIV) In short, there is strength and power in numbers to stand up against any attack of
        the enemy. When the bible says, “two can defend themselves,” the original picture in the Greek has two men
        standing back to back watching out for each other, making sure they can’t be blindsided by the opposing army.
        Now you may be thinking, “I thought that God was always with me.” And of course He is. He is always there to
        guide and protect you. But many times He protects you with the help of other believers. This verse is just a
        reminder that you shouldn’t try to fight all your battles on your own. The Pastor of our church constantly
        reminds us not to be a “lone ranger.” We all need each other. Can allowing attacks of the enemy be God’s way of
        encouraging people to get out of their comfort zone and join with fellow Christians? I think so. Not only so we
        can watch our own backs but so you can keep an eye on theirs as well. There is spiritual power in numbers.
      </p>

      <p>From the very inception of the original first century church, fellowship among believers has always been an
        essential part of the Christian life. The book of Acts said this of our Christian ancestors, “They devoted
        themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and prayer.” (Acts 2:42 NIV)
        Notice the importance of fellowship that Luke, the author of this book, mentions along with sound doctrine and
        prayer. Never take for granted the time you have with your brothers and sisters, because unfortunately we also
        see that there were many first century Christians that didn’t feel the need to be together. Like many of us
        today, they fell into the deadly trap of avoiding this gathering. To my own shame this is a trap that I stepped
        into many years ago myself. The verse in Hebrews says, “Don’t give up meeting together as some are in the habit
        of doing.” Notice they didn’t have a habit of GOING and meeting with other believers. The habit they created was
        that they STOPPED meeting with fellow believers. When I stopped serving God for over twenty years, it didn’t
        come all at once. It happened slowly and over a period of time. Sadly, for me I didn’t see the deadly sign that
        I was slipping away. That sign was easy to see and right there in front of me. The sign for me was this, I
        stopped going to church. Now we can argue that you don’t have to go to church to be a Christian and I’ll agree
        with you on that. But let’s be honest, once you’re a Christian, the Spirit He placed inside you has a natural
        draw to be around other believers. Strangely, you have an uneasy feeling when you don’t see these people for an
        extended period of time.
      </p>

      <p>If you’re a “lone ranger,” and you don’t feel the pull or the need to be around other believers consider this,
        1 John 1:17 says, “but if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one
        another…” Notice, it doesn’t say we have fellowship with Him (that is already assumed). It says if we walk in
        the light we have fellowship with other believers. It seems to be the natural progression that the more we walk
        in God’s light, the more we are drawn to spend time with our Christian brothers and sisters. That’s up to you to
        decide.

        I have a dear friend who has a simple rule when it comes to attending church. She says something like this, ”If
        you miss two consecutive weeks it’s excusable, three weeks is the beginning of a bad habit… As is the habit of
        some.”</p>

      <p>Just Something to Consider.
