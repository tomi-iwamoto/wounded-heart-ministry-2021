    <h1 class="hurting-title">A Word for the Brokenhearted</h1>

    <div class="hurting-text">
      <p>Are you feeling hurt, rejected, broken today? No matter what your circumstances, what you've done, where you
        are in life right now, God loves you. Here are words of comfort straight from the bible for you.</p>



      <div class="hurting-wrap">
        <h3>When we feel hopeless, weary or brokenhearted, we are ALWAYS welcomed into the arms of God.</h3>
        <p>Today, you may be feeling brokenhearted. We have all experienced difficult times in our lives no matter who
          we are. Some may be due to divorce, broken relationships, loss of family or pet, loss of a job, illness,
          family or friends turning on you... the list goes on. You may feel rejected, excluded, less than, and even
          abandoned- but God has NOT forgotten you. </p>
      </div>


      <div class="hurting-wrap">
        <h3>Here are some words of comfort just for you</h3>
        <p>Jesus says, “Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my
          yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your
          souls…” Matthew 11:28</p>
      </div>


      <div class="hurting-wrap">
        <h3>I feel so broken...</h3>
        <p>How does God feel about your broken heart?<br>
          “The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.” Psalm 34:18<br>
          “The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down…” Psalm 146:8<br>
          “He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.” Ps 147:3</p>
      </div>


      <div class="hurting-wrap">
        <h3>God sees your tears</h3>
        <p>“You keep track of all my sorrows. You have collected all my tears in your bottle. You have recorded each one
          in your book.” Psalm 56:8</p>

        <p><span>God sent his Son Jesus</span>  to take away your sin AND the pain that sin left in your life.
          Whatever you may be going through, Jesus desires to heal your heart, make you whole and give you a completely
          new life.</p>

      </div>


      <div class="hurting-wrap">
        <h3>God loves YOU, yes YOU!</h3>
        <p>"As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him..." Psalm
          103:13<br>

          "For God so loved the word that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish
          but have eternal life." John 3:16<br>

          "For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him..." Psalm 103:11
        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="hurting-wrap">
        <h3>Call on Him</h3>
        <p>"The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth." Psalm 145:18<br>

          "I love the LORD, for he heard my voice; he heard my cry for mercy." Psalm 116:1<br>

          "I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy. I pour out my complaint before him; before
          him I tell my trouble." Psalm 142:1-2</p>

        <p>Whatever the problem may be, go to God JUST AS YOU ARE. Be honest with him and pour your heart to Him. He is
          right there waiting for you to come. </p>
